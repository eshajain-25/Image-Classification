# Image-Classification
In my project, I'm working on building an automated system to classify retinal damage from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans. To do this, I'm utilized a pretrained VGG16 deep learning model, which has been previously trained on a vast dataset of images. The idea is to fine-tune this model using a specialized dataset of OCT scans that encompass various retinal conditions like (Far left) choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with neovascular membrane (white arrowheads) and associated subretinal fluid (arrows), (Middle left) Diabetic macular edema (DME) with retinal-thickening-associated intraretinal fluid (arrows), (Middle right) Multiple drusen (arrowheads) present in early AMD. (Far right) Normal retina with preserved foveal contour and absence of any retinal fluid/edema., and . By fine-tuning the VGG16 model, I aim to harness its feature extraction capabilities to accurately identify and classify these retinal conditions. The potential benefits of this system include early disease detection, reducing the workload on ophthalmologists, and improving the efficiency of diagnosing retinal damage.
